Running the Application
Start the Backend:
cd server
node index.js

Start the Frontend:
cd ../todo-app
npm start

Your to-do application should now be running on http://localhost:3000, 
and the backend API should be running on http://localhost:5000.
You can add and delete tasks using the frontend interface, 
and the changes will be reflected in the backend.
